# OpenGL Clock GUI App
This program was created with the intention of bettering my coding skills.
Written in <b>Linux Debian</b><br>
Languages are: <i>c++</i><br>
The animation uses the <b>tm struct</b> to obatian the actual system time.
This program can be used for what ever you want. I really don't care.<br>
If you find yourself entertained by this let me know! Add what ever you see fit.

<h3>Future plans for the clock</h3>
1) Add little lines all the way around the clock that each mark a second of the day.
2) Align the numbers used to mark the hours.
3) It's at the bottom of the list, but add sound effects as an optional setting in the name of learning.
4) enjoy its existiance!
